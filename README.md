based on input file that contains features such as age, education level, marital status, etc., a model is build and tuned. 
Thereafter feature engineering and elimination of less significant features is implemented  and  a prediction is run on a separated test data (which had never been seen while training the model). The best model is chosen (it appears to be random forest model) and tuning of model is performed for acheiving better results.
